# Naive-TicTacToe
A Naive Person vs Machine Tic Tac Toe game in Python

First turn is random. The machine is going to place mark randomly if there is not a position where the player or the machine has a chance to win. If there exists a position where the machine can win, it's going to place a mark there; if there is a position where the player can win, then the machine is going to block the player.
